# Flight Cancellations Analysis

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze flight cancellations to identify key contributing factors and predict future cancellations. This analysis aims to help airlines and passengers mitigate disruptions and improve overall operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following features:
- **Flight Date**: The scheduled departure date of the flight.
- **Airline**: The carrier operating the flight.
- **Departure & Arrival Airports**: Locations for takeoff and landing.
- **Weather Conditions**: Impact of temperature, wind speed, and visibility.
- **Air Traffic & Operational Constraints**: Flight volume and delays in scheduling.
- **Cancellations & Reasons**: Labels indicating whether a flight was canceled and why (e.g., weather, technical issues, crew shortages).

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: 
   - Importing raw flight data.
   - Handling missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Standardizing timestamps and categorical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identifying trends in flight cancellations across airlines and airports.
   - Visualizing weather impact on cancellations.
   - Analyzing peak cancellation periods.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new variables such as delay time bins, seasonality indicators, and weekday/weekend flags.
   - Encoding categorical features for machine learning models.

4. **Modeling & Prediction** (If Applied):
   - Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict cancellations.
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

5. **Insights & Business Recommendations**:
   - Identifying the most common reasons for cancellations.
   - Suggesting strategies to reduce operational disruptions.
   - Providing data-driven solutions for improved airline scheduling.

## Flowcharts & Visualizations
This project includes graphical representations to enhance understanding:
- **Cancellation Trend Analysis**: A time-series visualization of cancellations.
- **Heatmaps**: Correlation between different flight parameters.
- **Decision Tree Flowchart (If Used)**: Steps involved in cancellation prediction.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To execute the analysis, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Flight cancellations.ipynb"
```

## Results & Key Findings
- **Weather Impact**: A significant number of cancellations occur due to poor weather conditions, especially during winter.
- **Peak Cancellation Hours**: Flights scheduled in the early morning and late evening face higher cancellation rates.
- **Airport-Specific Trends**: Certain airports experience higher disruptions due to congestion and operational constraints.
- **Machine Learning Insights (if applicable)**: The best predictive model achieves an accuracy of XX% in forecasting cancellations.

## Conclusion & Recommendations
- Airlines should improve contingency planning for adverse weather conditions.
- Advanced scheduling models can optimize flight timings to reduce cancellations.
- Real-time data monitoring can enhance decision-making processes.
